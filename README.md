# Maddie's NeoVim config
A clean, fast, feature-rich IDE layer for my needs in [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/).
Written in Lua, designed for NeoVim v0.7.0 or higher.

## Some highlights
 - Written entirely in Lua, making it clean and modern for NeoVim
 - Uses [impatient.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/impatient.nvim) which greatly improves startup performance
 - Uses the latest NeoVim LSP features & tree-sitter for highlighting
 - Neat, small and structured files that are easy to read with some commenting
 - Helpful features for programming such as highlighting indents & whitespaces
 - Features for writing prose and taking notes, such as [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) and [orgmode](https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode)
 - Extensible Lua written NeoVim specific package manager from [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
 - Modern standard Lua plugins such as [lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) and [nvim-tree](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua)
 - Fixed scrolling in terminals like st with patches and smooth scrolling
 - Extra configuration for [Neovide](https://github.com/neovide/neovide), a graphical NeoVim client
 - Shortcuts for tabs & splits with the leader key as space
 - System clipboard, mouse and scrolling support
